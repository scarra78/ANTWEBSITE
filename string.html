            <h4> String Theory </h4> <!-- txt   -->
            <p>
                For hundreds of years, scientists have thought that the simplest objects in the universe are points,
                like dots. String theory says that this is wrong and that the simplest objects in the universe are
                shaped like pieces of string. These strings are so small that even when looked at very closely they look
                like points. Each basic particle is created by the strings vibrating in different patterns. The reason
                scientists had not thought of this idea for so long is that strings are much harder to work with than
                points. They seem to break such rules as causality and special relativity, which says that information
                cannot travel faster than the speed of light. <br></br>
                String theory has been developed because of a very important problem that has existed for almost 100
                years. Albert Einstein's theory that describes the universe on very large scales (it is called general
                relativity), and it disagrees with two theories that describe things on very small scales (they are
                called quantum mechanics and the standard model). There are also problems with the Standard Model: it
                includes about 20 numbers that seem to have no explanation; it has too many basic particles - some
                scientists think it needs to have fewer; and it does not include gravity, which is needed to explain
                weight. <br></br>
                Many of these problems can be solved by thinking of basic particles as strings. Now there is only one
                number with no explanation, which gives the size of the strings. String theory includes particles that
                cause gravity, called gravitons; finding this out delighted the scientists who work on string theory.
                So, string theory successfully brings General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics together.
                But there are some problems with string theory. Normally, we think of the universe as having 4
                dimensions, or basic directions. 3 of these basic directions can be thought of as "up/down",
                "forward/backward" and "left/right". The other direction is time. String theory needs 10 basic
                directions. <br></br>
                These six other directions can be explained if they are "curled up", so they are much too small to see.
                For example, by following the path of a spiral, it is possible to go a great distance along it without
                moving very far. The 6 other directions can be thought of as tiny spirals - strings can move along them
                a great distance but not seem to move. This can be looked at as a mathematical trickâ€”a trick that has
                little to do with the real world that can be seen and touched. Such tricks are allowed if they give a
                theory that can better tell us how things work. Each version allows different kinds of strings and says
                they work in different ways. String theory is supposed to be a theory of everything so there should be
                only one version, not 5. M-theory solves this problem.
