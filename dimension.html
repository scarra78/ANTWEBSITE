            <h4> 11 Dimentions </h4>  <!-- txt   -->
            <p>
                The 11th dimension is a characteristic of space-time that has been proposed as a possible answer to
                questions that arise in superstring theory. The theory of superstrings involves the existence of nine
                dimensions of space and one dimension of time (a total of 10 dimensions). According to this notion, we
                observe only three spatial dimensions and one time dimension because the other six spatial dimensions
                are "curled up" or "compactified." <br></br>
                According to superstring theory, all of the elementary particles in the universe are composed of
                vibrating, one-dimensional mathematical objects known as strings. The theory does not explicitly state
                what the strings are made of or where they come from; rather, they are proposed as geometric ideals.
                Each string has a length of only 10-35 meters, many times smaller than the diameter of the nucleus of an
                atom. Any given subatomic particle (or hadron) is made of a string that vibrates and rotates at the
                speed of light. A particular hadron gets its unique identity from the manner in which the string rotates
                and vibrates according to the dynamics of Einstein's theory of general relativity. The frequency of
                vibration corresponds to the mass of the particle. <br></br>
                The nagging question remains, "Where do the strings come from?" Also, there are five different versions
                of superstring theory that explain the way subatomic particles behave. Are all five versions correct, or
                are some correct and others wrong? In an attempt to answer these questions, some physicists have
                suggested that there exists an 11th dimension, which is compactified like the other six spatial
                dimensions we do not directly observe. Superstring theory with the inclusion of the 11th dimension is
                sometimes called M theory or the theory of everything (TOE).
