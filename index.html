            <h4>M-Theory</h4> <!-- txt   -->
            <p>
                To understand M-theory one must first have some knowledge of <a href="string.html">String Theory</a>.In
                1995 Edward Witten started what has been called the Second Superstring Revolution by introducing
                M-theory to the world. This theory combines the 5 different string theories (along with a previously
                abandoned attempt to unify General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics called 11D-Supergravity) into one
                theory. What Witten actually did was to predict that the fact that all these different theories were
                connected was a result of there being some underlying theory of which they were all approximations. This
                theory is somewhat vague in nature and has not yet been pinned down. <br></br>

                Additionally, it was found that the equations that required string theory to exist in 10 dimensions were
                actually approximations as well. The proposed M-theory would need one extra dimension and instead be a
                theory that takes place in 11 dimensions. Witten has himself compared this idea in simple terms to a
                general who takes up a position on a hilltop, the extra space-coordinate, to get a better view of the
                battlefield's two other dimensions.
                <br></br>
                The combination is accomplished by knitting together a web of relationships between each of the string
                theories called dualities (specifically, S-duality, T-duality, and U-duality). Each of these dualities
                provides a way of converting one of the string theories into another. T-duality is probably the most
                easily explained of the dualities. It has to do with the size, written as R, of the curled up dimensions
                of the string theories. It was discovered that by taking a Type IIA string theory that has a size R and
                changing the radius to 1/R the result will end up being what is equivalent to a Type IIB theory of size
                R. This duality, along with the others, creates connections between all 5 (or 6, if supergravity is
                counted) theories. The fact that these dualities existed had been known before Witten came up with the
                idea of M-theory. <br></br>

                Additional amusement has come for many in guessing what the M might stand for (possibilities include
                Matrix, Magic, Muffin, Mystery, Mother and Membrane). Regardless of what the M might possibly mean,
                M-theory has become one of the most interesting and active areas of research in theoretical physics
                today
